# Introduction



Welcome to the documentation of the audiometer project, which was developed as part of the "Project Python and Acoustics 2024" at the Technical University of Berlin. This project aims to programme an automated audiometer that determines the hearing ability of test persons in a precise and user-friendly way.

An audiometer is a diagnostic device that is used to determine a person's hearing thresholds. There are various methods for carrying out hearing tests; in this project, the single-tone method with increasing level, via headphones and without masking, was realised. This method is standardised in accordance with DIN EN ISO 8253-1.

The audiometer tests the frequency bands from 125 Hz to 8000 Hz. The output is an audiogram in which the hearing thresholds can be read and a CSV file is saved, which can be used for further processing of the data. 

In addition to the classic audiometer test procedure, there is also the option of binaural testing and screening audiometry.
In addition, the respondent is familiarised with the programme by means of a briefing and a test run in the 1000 Hz frequency band to ensure that the respondent has understood the test procedure.

In principle, the programme is designed so that it can be carried out independently by the respondent using the GUI. However, we recommend supervision by a specialist in order to obtain validated results. 

Please note that this computerised audiometer is only intended to assess your hearing and does not replace an accurate diagnosis by a specialist. For a more accurate diagnosis, please consult your doctor.
